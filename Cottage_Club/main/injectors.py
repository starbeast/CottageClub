            {% endfor %}

        ``comment.user`` attribute will be selected using ``select_related`` and
        ``comment.user._profile_cache`` (exposed by get_profile method) will be

class GenericInjector(RelatedInjector):
    """ RelatedInjector but for GenericForeignKey's.
        Manager for selecting all generic-related objects in one (two) SQL queries.
        Selection is performed for a list of objects. Resulting data is aviable as attribute
        of original model. Only one instance per object can be selected. Example usage:
        select (and make accessible as user.avatar) all avatars for a list of user when
        avatars are AttachedImage's attached to User model with is_main=True attributes.

        Example::

            from django.contrib.auth.models import User
            from generic_images.models import AttachedImage

            users = User.objects.all()[:10]
            AttachedImage.injector.inject_to(users, 'avatar', is_main=True)

            # i=0..9: users[i].avatar is AttachedImage objects with is_main=True.
            # If there is no such AttachedImage (user doesn't have an avatar),
            # users[i].avatar is None


        For this example 2 or 3 sql queries will be executed:
            1. one query for selecting 10 users,
            2. one query for selecting all avatars (images with is_main=True) for selected users
            3. and maybe one query for selecting content-type for User model

        One can reuse GenericInjector manager for other models that are supposed to
        be attached via generic relationship. It can be considered as an addition to
        GFKmanager and GFKQuerySet from djangosnippets for different use cases.
